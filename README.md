MATLAB codes that correlate attention and pupil widening with subjective attention of several individuals on viewing a 5-minute video. 

The user of the Tobii eye tracker https://developer.tobiipro.com/commonconcepts/coordinatesystems.html viewed a one-hour video.
Every 5 minutes he has to answer a self-test on his attention. The answers vary between 1 and 10. Note of 1/10: not at all attentive and 10: very attentive. 
The code makes it possible to establish the correlation coefficient between the answers of the individual and the widening of his pupils.
